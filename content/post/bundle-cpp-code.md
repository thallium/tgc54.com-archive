As a competitive programmer, I always want to find a solution to avoid copy-and-pasting my algorithm library so I can write more complex code lol.

Inspired by [Egor](https://codeforces.com/profile/Egor)'s rust bundler, I wondered is there something similar for C++? I remembered that I read [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77139) long time ago then I spent some time finding that blog but it's not a bundler and looks quite complicated. In the comment someone mentioned using the `cpp` command which does the preprocessing work. As you may know, `#include` is basically copy-and-paste so this actually sounds right, but the problem is that it also copies and pastes the standard library which is over 200k+ lines of code. So I dug a bit further to see if it's possible to skip system header and found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20889599), but it only works for clang which what I'm using so I didn't look for a solution for gcc.

The command is:
```sh
clang++ -I/your/path/to/library/ -E -P -nostdinc++ -nobuiltininc main.cpp > bundled.cpp
```

Explanation:

- `-E` Only run the preprocessor
- `-P` Disable linemarker output in -E mode
- `-nostdinc++` Disable standard #include directories for the C++ standard library
- `-nobuiltininc` Disable builtin #include directories (may not be needed)

As `#include` of system header isn't preserved, you can add the system headers using another command and I made a shell function to do that:

```sh
expand_cpp () {
	clang++ -I/your/path/to/library/ -E -P -nostdinc++ -nobuiltininc $1 > bundled.cpp
	gsed -i "1s/^/#include <bits\/stdc++.h>\n/" bundled.cpp
}
```
