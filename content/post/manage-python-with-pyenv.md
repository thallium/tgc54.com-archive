There is problem managing python version with your package manager. An easy solution is to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv):

1. Install pyenv with your package manager. For MacOS, it's `brew install pyenv`.
2. Install desired python version: `pyenv install <version>`
3. Set global python version `pyenv global <version>`
4. Set up your shell environment for Pyenv, for zsh, add this to your `.zshrc`:
```sh
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
